# 🛍️ Frontend React Shop 🛍️

Hello there, wonderful human! 👋 Welcome to the **Frontend React Shop** repository. This is an API frontend application using the magic of React with ContextAPI, TypeScript, TailwindCSS and Vite to work with your favorite backend technology.

## 🌟 What's Inside?

This application is a treasure trove of modern web development practices. It provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules. It uses two official plugins: `@vitejs/plugin-react` which uses Babel for Fast Refresh and `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` which uses SWC for Fast Refresh.
