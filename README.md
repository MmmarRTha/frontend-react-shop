# 🛍️ Frontend React Shop 🛍️

Hello there, wonderful human! 👋 Welcome to the **Frontend React Shop** repository. This is a delightful little project that's all about building a frontend application using the magic of React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## 🌟 What's Inside?

This application is a treasure trove of modern web development practices. It provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules. It uses two official plugins: `@vitejs/plugin-react` which uses Babel for Fast Refresh and `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc` which uses SWC for Fast Refresh.

## 📂 Project Structure

Here's a quick tour of the project's main directories and files:

- `public`: This is where we keep public assets that will be served by Vite.
- `src`: The heart of the application - the source code.
- `.eslintrc.cjs`: Our trusty ESLint configuration file.
- `package.json`: The list of package dependencies for the project.
- `postcss.config.js`: Configuration for PostCSS.
- `tailwind.config.js`: Configuration for Tailwind CSS.
- `tsconfig.json`: Configuration for TypeScript.
- `tsconfig.node.json`: Additional TypeScript configuration for Node.js.
- `vite.config.ts`: Configuration for Vite.
